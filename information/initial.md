# Initial approach

The algorithm must :

- [x] Find a path to go from A to B
- [x] Use a map (2 dimensional array)
- [x] Avoid obstacles
- [x] Find the ***shortest*** path to go from A to B
- [x] Output number of steps

I searched for the different existing algorithms and tried to understand their basic functioning.

Then, make a simple one myself, finding a path from A to B, without taking into account obstacles, and add more conditions to it.
