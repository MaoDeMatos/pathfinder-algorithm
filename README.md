# Pathfinder algorithm

[Initial approach](./information/initial.md)

## Goal

Make a pathfinder algorithm capable of using a 2D array as a map to find the shortest path between two points.

It must :

- Travel **only up/down** and **left/right**, *no diagonals allowed*
- Travel through ***1***s and avoid ***0***s
- Return the distance of the shortest path
- Return the map with the path displayed
- Return an error message if there are no paths, invalid data is provided, etc...

## What it does

- Finds the shortest path from point A (initial position) to point B (final position)
- Use a JSON file as input
- Generates a map if there is no JSON file given
- Displays error messages and the mode used (random map or JSON file)
- Displays the map in the CLI with a coloured array, AFTER the algorithm searches through it

## What I did

I first made a `Matrix` object along with its `MatrixGenerator`, to make random matrixes.

I made JSON files to store predefined grids.

I followed my initial plan (doing the first version entirely myself), but I lacked some ways to get a trace of where the algorithm already checked, so I went online to read a bit about Dijkstra, A Star and DFS/BFS.

I was tempted to go for A Star because my movement system was a bit closer to it, but the conditions and queue system were easier to implement from BFS pseudo-code, so I did the rest by taking inspiration from BFS.

## How to use

If you want to use a JSON file :

```sh
# In the root dir
php functional.php {JSON file path}
```

```sh
# Example
php functional.php ./data/example.json
```

If you want to generate a random map :

```sh
# Simply don't use any arguments
php functional.php
```

## JSON File format

The JSON files provided must be structured as following :

```json
{
  "0": [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    ["e", 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, "S"],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  ]
}
```

```sh
IT WILL ONLY TAKE THE FIRST ELEMENT IN ACCOUNT
```

```sh
YOU MUST HAVE A "E" AND A "S" IN THE ARRAY OR IT WILL DISPLAY AN "INVALID FILE FORMAT" ERROR
```
